Born and raised in Beijing, China, I lived in Shanghai for five years before moving to Bloomington, Indiana in 2019. I got my Bachelor's degree in accounting from [School of Management](https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/en/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). During my time at the University, I participated in the student exchange program and spent a semester at [School of Business](https://www.albany.edu/business) at [University at Albany](https://www.albany.edu/).
In the interim, I have also worked at [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/cn/en/footerlinks/office-locator/offices-china/shanghai.html) and [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/locations/mckinsey-client-capabilities-network/shanghai#:~:text=168%20Hubin%20Road,%2B86%20(21)%206386%202000) Shanghai office.

My passion for management scholarship started in the "strategic management" class in my senior year and grew over time. After working as a research assistant for three months at the [Department of Management](https://business.okstate.edu/departments_programs/management/index.html), [Spears Business School](https://business.okstate.edu/), [Oklahoma State University](https://business.okstate.edu/) in the summer of 2018, I decided to pursue a PhD in this field. Now I am in the third year of the doctoral program. Outside of research, I love swimming and dancing.
