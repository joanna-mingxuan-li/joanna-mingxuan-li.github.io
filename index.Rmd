Welcome!

I am an incoming assistant professor at the [Department of Strategy, Entrepreneurship and Management](https://www.ualberta.ca/strategy-entrepreneurship-management/index.html) at the University of Alberta. I earned my Ph.D. in Strategic Management and Organization Theory at the department of [Management and Entrepreneurship](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/departments/management-entrepreneurship/index.html), [Kelley School of Business](https://kelley.iu.edu/), Indiana University Bloomington in June 2024.

&nbsp;

My current research interest lies at the intersection of strategy and organization theory, with a particular focus on questions at the business-society interface. Specifically, I am interested in understanding the interplay between institutions, organizations, and inequalities, especially concerning new forms of organizing like digital platforms. Second, I am interested in understanding firms’ strategic positioning through the lens of optimal distinctiveness.
