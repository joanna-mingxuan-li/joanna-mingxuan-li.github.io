Welcome!


I am a Ph.D. candidate in Strategic Management and Organization Theory at the department of [Management and Entrepreneurship](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/departments/management-entrepreneurship/index.html), [Kelley School of Business](https://kelley.iu.edu/), [Indiana University Bloomington](https://indiana.edu/).

&nbsp;

My current research interest lies at the intersection of strategy and organization theory, with a particular focus on questions at the business-society interface. Specifically, I am interested in understanding the interplay between institutions, organizations, and inequalities, especially concerning new forms of organizing like digital platforms. My job market paper delves into the role of platforms in shaping gender inequalities in the music streaming industry.

Second, I am interested in understanding firms’ strategic positioning through the lens of optimal distinctiveness.

I am on the Fall 2023 academic job market.
